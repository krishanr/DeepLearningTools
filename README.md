# DeepLearningTools
Here are some basic tools I built on top of keras to facilitate deep learning experiments. The jupyter notebook EvaluationModels_Mnist2.ipynb runs these tools on the MNIST dataset as a proof of concept. The jupyter notebook can run on any image dataset with changes to a few lines of code.

Notes:
Make sure to have the folder trained_models in the local directory for the code to work correctly.

A special thanks to Vik for giving me the idea to create this class for running
deep learning experiments.
